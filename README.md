A Luau library for creating dynamic and functional configuration objects and graphical user interfaces.

## Contributing
You can contribute to `config` by helping create new themes and datatypes for the library. As of writing this, config has 1 theme and 4 datatypes.

Additionally, almost all of the library has no documentation, so you can also help out by documenting the source code.

For an example on how to create a theme, you can take a look at the `base` theme created by alliancecrusader and how it utilizes the back-end to create a GUI.
